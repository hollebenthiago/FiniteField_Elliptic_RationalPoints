# FiniteField_Elliptic_RationalPoints
Some simulations on the statistics of rational points of elliptic function fields over finite fields.

In the notebook there are some simulations that calculate the mean number of rational points of an elliptic function field over a finite field and other related statistical properties.

This was made for a seminar on elliptic function fields.
### To dos:

- Hyperelliptic function fields
- Try to make it faster
- Tests on finite extensions of a fixed finite field
